## Checklist

Hello! Welcome to send a PR to us! Here is a simple PR checklist:

- [ ] Format your code, by `yarn format`. A good format is helpful for
      everyone.
- [ ] (NOT NOW) Make sure tests are passed.
- [ ] If you need to update the document, then update. The documents are here:
  - `README.md` in the root folder of project, about what the project is and
    why the project exists.
  - `README.md` in the package `back`, `front` and `theme-shortcut`(at
    the path `front/packages/theme-shortcut`).
  - In folder `docs`, there are the other documents.
